This repository contains data and scripts in support of discussions on data structure, data format, and data tools and processes for the University of Oxford MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine.

## Tidy data

**Tidy data** is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## Tidying up messy datasets

Real datasets can, and often do, violate the three precepts of tidy data in almost every way imaginable. While occasionally you do get a dataset that you can start analysing immediately, this is the exception, not the rule. The five most common problems with messy datasets, along with their remedies:

* Column headers are values, not variable names
* Multiple variables are stored in one column
* Variables are stored in both rows and columns
* Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table
* A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables
